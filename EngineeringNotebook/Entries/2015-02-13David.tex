End of the Season (or so I thought)

 This week I worked on our end-of-season PowerPoint and started working with Google Sketchup, as, for all I knew, our season was over. Then, on Thursday (2/12), Mrs. Lannen told us that she had just gotten an email saying that we had been invited to State, as there was one spot left.

  It turns out that we had won the 3rd place Inspire Award, so we were up next up after the four teams that qualified for State on the day of the tournament. We were all very happy and immediately began discussing what needed to happen these next two weeks.

%TODO: Do I need an image? We didn't do much work this week.
