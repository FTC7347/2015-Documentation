Working on the Deployment of the Deflector

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}

 This week I did some more maintenance on the robot and helped the two other teams with their Samantha's, but I mostly worked on a deploying mechanism for the deflector.

 As opposed to the deploying system for the previous competition, this deploying mechanism is motorized. A small metal beam is attached to a servo, which pushes the deflector up. Rubber bands take the deflector the rest of the way.
