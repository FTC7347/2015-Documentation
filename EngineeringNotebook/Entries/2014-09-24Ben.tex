Brainstorming, Calculating

 Brainstorming&
 We established our intake last week so we went over our lifter/scorers and went over what path we want to pursue using pros and cons of all the ideas the team had.
 \\
 \hline
 Calculating&  
 We started by doing a bunch of calculations to see if it is even possible to launch a ball to the correct height. Alex is in charge of the calculations but Filip and I helped  him with measurements. See Alexâ€™s notebook for calculation

\section*{Brainstorming}
As a team we went through all the pros and cons of our four lifter/scorers: 
\fontbf{Batched:}

Pros: possible, easy, reliable, simpler
Cons: unreliable

\fontbf{Continuous Feed:}
Pros: faster than batched
Cons: unreliable

\fontbf{Scissor lift with conveyor belts:}
Cons: complex mechanically, take up a lot of room, require a lot of power to run, slower than a shot, Gear system to reverse direction of belts: difficult to build

Pros: continuous feed, multiple balls traversing mechanism at once, possible with the parts that we have at hand, store balls along conveyor belt and score balls in end game. 

\fontbf{repeating sling shot:}
Cons: requires large rates of fire, needs to be super reliable, needs to be able to handle a failed shot, wearing out the surgical tubing (loses elasticity over time) 

Pros: Faster feed, lower transit times (to not get penalized for carrying more than 5 balls), reliable, easy to build, shoots straight up, more consistent than spring shot, faster reset time than spring shot

\fontbf{Spring shot:}
 Back up plan if slingshot fails

\fontbf{Belt variant:}
Cons: very slow (but not as slow as scissor lift)  balls could fall off easily, hard to build, unreliable

Pros: see pros of scissor lift

\fontfb{Guide tube with pulley system:}
hard to build a telescoping tube, manufacture the plastic tubing very precisely. and integrate pulley system.

\fontfb{Best Idea:}
 Sling shot

We are going to split our group into two teams: One to prototype the intake system and one to prototype the sling shot. We are going to design them first and get a bill of materials. 

We split of into two groups for the two prototypes: 
Intake: Mat, David, Alex
Slingshot: Ben, Filip, Nick 

\section*{Math}
Me, Nick, and Filip helped Alex calculate whether or not we can actually launch the balls 120cm with the surgical tubing we have. See Alex's enginering notebook for all math calculations.
