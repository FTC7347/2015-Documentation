Research and Calculations

Intake calculations

Matt and David looked over the ideal geometry for the intake device to the slingshot.

Launch calculations
  &
Alex, Ben and I calculated the power output of the Tetrix DC motors: 10.98W. The masses of the small and large balls are 28.9g and 11.68g, respectively. We then used this data to compute the theoretical maximum rate of fire.

%We will focus on rewriting this in a LaTeX file.
We organized the team into the FTC7347 Github organization. For the launch calculations,
Alex introduced us to LATEX format. Today I watched the PTC Robotalk Introduction for
an introduction to CREO.
