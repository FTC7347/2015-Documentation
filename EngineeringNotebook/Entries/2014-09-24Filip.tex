Research and Calculations

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}}
  \hline
Intake calculations
  &
Matthew and David looked over the ideal geometry for the intake device to the slingshot.
\hline
Launch calculations
  &
Alex, Ben and I calculated the power output of the Tetrix DC motors, 10.98W,
and the mass of the balls, 28.9g and 11.68g to compute the theoretical maximum rate of fire.
  \hline
\end{tabular}
We will focus on rewriting this in a LaTeX file.
We organized the team into the FTC7347 Github organization. For the launch calculations,
Alex introduced us to LATEX format. Today I watched the PTC Robotalk Introduction for
an introduction to CREO.
