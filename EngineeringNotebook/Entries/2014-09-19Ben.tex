Brainstorming, Designing, and Promoting FTC

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}

 Brainstorming&
 We started our brainstorming by making three subsystems for scoring blocks:
 Intake, Lifter, and Scorer. We had a bunch of designs down and ideas flowing.
 As a team we we’re able to list pros and cons of all the designs mentioned and narrowed
 it down to just a few quality designs.

 Designing&
 Once we had our ideas pinpointed that we thought would be best for accomplishing
 the challenge we started to design different components of the robot.
 Me, Nick, and Alex mainly focused on the intake method of picking up balls.

 Promoting FTC and FIRST&
 I went to a lego robotics meeting with my FRC team for recruiting Lego Robotics coaches
 for the FLL league at liberty that we’re starting up. We wanted to promote all three
 levels of FIRST. We had old lego robots for demo, I brought a ball shooting FTC robot
 I built and my FRC team brought their worlds robot from last year.
 We demo’d all the robots and got the kids exited for robotics, hopefully they will
 move up in the FIRST levels and be on the Liberty FTC team in the future.

\section*{Brainstorming}
Ways to play the game:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Tip rolling goal onto ramp. Shuttle balls up and down ramp
 \item Grab rolling goal and drive around with it putting balls in
 \item Put balls into center goal %TODO This may need to be corrected
\end{itemize}
