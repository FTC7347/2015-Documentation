Working on a New Guide Tube

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 This week I did some more maintenance on the robot and helped the two other teams with their Samantha's, but I mostly worked on a new guide tube. It is made out a three pieces of cardstock.

 This new guide tube is made to be close to the dimensions of the old guide tube, but instead out of cardstock. The three pieces of cardstock fit together in a similar way to one of the old wooden guide tube pieces.

The guide tube is 7.5" x 4". The long sides are made out of one sheet of cardstock each and the short sides are made out of one sheet of cardstock cut in half longways. Here is a diagram of the design so far. It's a top view.
