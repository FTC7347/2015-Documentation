We added controllers to the wiring and remapped the code to the new layout.
Testing revealed poorly connected cables and an area of too much friction 
on the launcher, so we fixed those. The cardboard plate was reinforced and
we've measured dimensions to replace it with a sheet of plastic tipped with
a flexible end to grip the balls coming through the intake. While testing
the distance of the launcher we discussed diverting the balls to aim more
reliably upwards and forwards; on Friday a prototype should be added. \\

Today was an accomplishment with the wiring and Samantha module working perfectly.
