Code Listings and Git

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 I worked with David to set up code listings.&
 We are using the listings package and have created a custom style for RobotC which formats and colors the code like the RobotC development environment does. It is also set up to be automatically available to any of our entries. \\
 \hline
 I continued to help Ben and Nick use git.&
 Nick is getting better at merging, but is still not able to handle the full process independently. I had to re-teach Ben how to save a file and quit in vi, which is used by the git bash for windows to write commit messages.\\
 \hline
 I helped Nick put together the basic robot frame for the test chassis.&
 Now that we have begun with hands on assembly, productivity is much better.\\
