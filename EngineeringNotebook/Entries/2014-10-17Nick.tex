 Helping other teams&
This week I helped other teams by creating some more sample code. I also built a simple model showing how wiring works. It has a servo controller and a dc controller so that I can show the sample programs with it.

We continued testing the surgical tubing as well as began building a prototype for the intake device.

\section*{Helping other teams}
This week I created another sample program that uses the logitech controller to control the motors.

\lstinputlisting[style = RobotC]{DCTest.c}

The code shows people how to move the motors using the joystick, demonstrates using a deadzone for the joystick, and shows them how to use dc motors.

\section*{Logo Design}
I created a logo for our team - Children of the Matrix. The logo has a brain, with one half being organic and the other half looking like part of a computer. Children of the Matrix means people who can connect to the internet with thier minds, so I found the brain with two sections fitting. I also added in the two prominent letters from our name into the brain: C on the organic side of the brain and M on the technological side.
Here is a picture of the logo:
