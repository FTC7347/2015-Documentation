Naming Team And Administrative Tasks

 This week, we tried to come up with a good team name, and failed. &
 Hopefully, the current team name isn’t final, because I doubt anyone will find it funny. That said, I don’t understand it, so maybe it is hilarious in a way I can’t appreciate. \\

The only idea we’ve had for a name so far is
“$(\lambda x.xx)(\lambda x.xx)$”,
which doesn’t make sense to me, but my brother assures me it’s a good name. I’ve never done this before, so I have no idea what a reasonable team name suggestion is.
	The other thing we did today was discuss the team organization and elect a captain and assistant captain. My brother is the captain, and Ben is the assistant captain. My brother is splitting the team into a few different groups at the start to design the basic parts of the robot.
