Fabricating Polycarb

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 Guide Tube& I made the pieces of the guide tube out of the plastic.
\end{tabular}

I first cut all the rectangular panels then we taped them into shape and checked that everything fit nicely. I then disassembled them and made the various slots and bolt holes, then made a jig to hold the pieces in rigid alignment while the adhesive cured for 24 hours.
