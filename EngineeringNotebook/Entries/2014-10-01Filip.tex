 We considered the lifting mechanisms from looking at last year's FTC competition,
 but our calculations for intake appear to remain viable. Alex has written the \LaTeX for
 the maximum rate of fire while introducing us to the syntax. I am following the PTC Robotalk
 tutorial for using CREO. Ben is researching the materials we can use in accordance with the
 rules for the robot's components. The launch mechanism is being designed by Matt, David, and Nick.
 And in accord, our team name is \textbf{Children of the Matrix}, which is nice, I guess.

We're all working independently, but next week we plan to reconcile our efforts and begin the
actual construction of the robot.
