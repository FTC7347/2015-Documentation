Breaking my elbow and rebuilding intake

 This week, we rebuilt the intake mechanism to be more durable. &
 The intake has more support now, so it doesn't wiggle as much as it used to. \\

I fractured my elbow playing basketball on Monday, so I missed over half of the week. I also can't do much work, since my arm is in a sling. The rest of my team, on the other hand, has been hard at work to improve the robot. Our original intake design was only mounted to one side of the robot, where it connected to the motor. This configuration wasn't very strong, so we decided to improve it. The intake now connects to both sides with extra supporting and reinforcing parts.
