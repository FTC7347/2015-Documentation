Our current plan for launching the balls into the tubes is a slingshot. But we need a ball holder that will hold the balls and release them into the tube. The best way to do this is to make a piece on CREO that can perfectly fit a ball and has four holes that can attach to the surgical tubing. Filip and I were in charge of building this piece on CREO.

Now that I have all the pieces cut and ready to be assembled some members from other teams were willing to put it together. Rob, Eric, and JJ are going to put the pieces together. I got them started and went out to make sure they're on the right path and putting all the pieces together correctly. I plan on helping them less and less.

I was in charge of designing the ball holder for our slingshot and building it in Creo. It was pretty hard as I'm new to Creo and it will take me a while to get used to. Will Werst, a member on my FRC team, helped me make the piece in Creo. He's a great teacher who knows a lot about Creo. With his guidance I was able to build the part using the revolve tool. Now all we have to do is take this piece that I CADed up and bring it to FRC. They have a 3D printer that can print our piece for us. CADing up pieces can be incredibly useful. If we need to make a slight change to the design because the ball wouldn't fit in the cup we can easily just make the changes in CREO and spit out the piece again on the 3D printer. Now that I know the basics of CREO, Filip and I plan on designing our entire robot in CREO and this is what we'll be working on next week.

It was a rough start for the build team but they’ve got it all figured out now. It took them a couple days to figure out how to put it together, but they have all the holes for one ramp predrilled and will start putting it together next week. I’ll let them off on their own and we should have a built field here soon.
