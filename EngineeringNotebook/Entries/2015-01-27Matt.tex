Implementing the new deflector

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 We finished the new deflector, but there's nowhere to put it yet. We're also working on making the robot lighter and stronger.
&
 David built a prototype for the guide tube made out of paper, but it wasn't strong enough. We've replaced the slide that extends the tube with a stronger, less damaged one.

\end{tabular}

My next task will most likely be either to find a way to mount the deflector or help David build the guide tube. We also need to start worrying about making our robot pass inspection, since our next tournament is coming up soon.
