Adjustments for the State Tournament

 This week we created a list of everything that needed to happen before Super-Regionals, especially problems that needed to be fixed. We also became proficient in taking permanent marker off a whiteboard, as we started making the list with a permanent marker. More importantly we started building a test robot to test a new launcher design. It will be a cylinder of soft foam with a dense core in the middle to give it a lot of inertia. Standardized testing wreaked havoc on our schedule, and, as we meet in class, we did not get much done this week. Standardized testing also robbed us of our computers, which contributed to the lack of work that happened this week.&
 I am very excited to go to Super-Regionals. It will be a lot of work though. Hopefully we can make up the time we lost this week. Our shop is much cleaner now because Mrs. Lannen, our coach, organized a cleaning session one of the days that we were without laptops.\\
