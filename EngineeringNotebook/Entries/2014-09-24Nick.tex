Unfortunately I was home sick for most of the classtime this weeks and was unable to get much done because of this. However, I did manage to set up a github account and familiarize myself with the website. The other teammates did this as well.

I wasn't able to do much this week since I was sick for so much of the week, but our team managed to set up github accounts for our team and each individual team member. This will allow us to organize our engineering notebooks and we can work on the same things at the same time more easily.
