\section*{building}
We built a grabber on the back of the robot to grab onto the base of the tube and drag it with us. We also replaced the main launcher with a plastic counterpart so that it is stronger, hits the ball with more force, and doesnt break very easily.
\section*{Wiring}
We fixed up the wiring some more and soldered the wires to the motors to make them stay on better and to save space.

Here is a picture of me soldering the wires to the motor:
