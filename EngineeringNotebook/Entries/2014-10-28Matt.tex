Unfortunately, David and I assumed that we would have 13" to work with, which turned out to not be the case. Since the front wheels are mounted such that there is no extra space for the sweeper, it will instead have to be mounted between the wheels. I reduced the width of the cardboard from 12.5" to 7".
