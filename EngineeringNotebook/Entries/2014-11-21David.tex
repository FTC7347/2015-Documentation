The Samantha Module and Wiring Diagram

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 This week, I worked on the Samantha Module. It is still not set up correctly, but we are taking steps to make sure it works.

 The configuration of the electronics was changed, so the power poles are a little bit out of wack. This can be fixed, however. The router may need to be reconfigured, as the Samantha Module is still not working.
