The deflector at the top of the guide tube was assembled today, and the linear slide and back support for the ramp were added, though we had to stay after school to finish them. David's cardstock prototype for the guide tube had fitting measurements, so Ben remade the tubes out of cardboard until we get polycarbonate. We had trouble fitting the large dimensions within the size constraints of the map, so an unnecessary crease in each piece may undermine the structural integrity of the tube during testing. We've decided to try the reverse direction of the three parts to avoid ball collision along the edge. \\

I like how far we've progressed using the basic materials, but the ramp has not been 3D printed yet, so we are still unable to test the balls landing in the tubes or the lifting of the linear slide.
