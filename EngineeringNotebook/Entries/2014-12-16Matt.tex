Building scorer

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}

 We're putting on the cardboard prototype of the scoring tube, and hopefully we'll be able to test it successfully today. &
 The current prototype doesn't fold yet, so it doesn't fit inside the 18" box. Fixing that is our highest priority, after testing. \\

\end{tabular}

The ramp wasn't ready when we were testing, so we just dropped the balls in from the top of the launcher. Most of them got launched out the front, which was to be expected, but the few that did go back up made it all the way back out of the launcher, so that's a good sign. Hopefully we'll  be able to test with the ramp on Friday, the next time we meet.
