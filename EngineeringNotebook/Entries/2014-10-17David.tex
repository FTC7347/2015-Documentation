Code for Moving Servo with Joystick

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 Today, I worked with the rookie team on making a servo work with the joystick. We were not able to get it to work, but this year being my first year coding in RobotC and uncertainty over whether the computer was set up right didn't help.

 I and the person I was working with both learned a lot more about using RobotC with joysticks and servos despite failing to move the servo with the joystick.
