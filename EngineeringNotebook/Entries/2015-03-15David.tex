Spring Break and the weeks before and after (3/9 - 3/27)

 Week of 3/9&
 This week we tested different launching mechanisms with different materials to try to improve on the design we used for the State tournament. None of them worked very well consistently, and none were able to launch big balls as well as our previous design.\\
 Week of 3/16&
 This week we decided to reattach our old launching mechanism as it was the best mechanism we had tested so far. The robot is coming together again as the Super-Regional tournament approaches. We also made ~470 buttons at FRC Team #4499 The Highlander's shop to distribute at the tournament.\\
 Week of 3/23&
 This is currently in the future...\\
