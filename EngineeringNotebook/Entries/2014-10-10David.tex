Tasks Related to the 3D Printer and Joystick Control

 This week I worked on getting a servo motor working with a joystick. Even though I had the correct code, RobotC was not set up the right way, so it did not work. Nick's computer was set up correctly, so when the code ran on his computer it worked.

 I was finished with the task of getting the joystick and servo working by the end of class Thursday. I missed class on Friday, but my teammates continued their work on their tasks. Nick has a lot more code which can be used as a template for doing basic tasks.
