While testing our first attempt at making our robot score while fitting inside an 18" cube, the intake started squeaking and then stopped working entirely. It turned out that the screws attaching the motor to the chasis hadn't been tightened all the way, so the gears were slipping and eventually lost connection. I fixed the screws, and the rest of the team made sure the other parts were going to stay in place and strengthened the intake in other places.
