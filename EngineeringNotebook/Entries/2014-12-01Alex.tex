Rewiring

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}

 Conversion to powerpoles&
 I started work on rewiring the robot using powerpoles to ease maintainence. However, to permit continued testing and hardware development, it must be done slowly and piecemeal.\\
 \hline
 Plastic Parts&
 We began planning for the conversion of parts of our ball handling system from cardboard to plastic. I hope that these efforts aren't premature.\\

We have began converting the robots electronics to use powerpoles on all the power cables. This will make maintainence much faster once it is complete. I am also working to improve the wire routing on our robot. We will probably want to solder short wires terminated in powerpoles directly on to the motors rather than using the plastic clip provided in the kit. This will result in a slightly reduced profile of the motors and a more sturdy connection.
