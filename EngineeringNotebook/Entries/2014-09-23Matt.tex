%Brainstorming


%We made decisions about which prototype to use.

%We’ve come up with pros and cons, but haven’t made a whole lot of progress yet.

%We have 2 different designs for both types of scorer we came up with, batched and continuous. Alex made a document containing sketches for all the designs, and Ben made a list of pros and cons. I think that the best way to score the balls is with a continuous scorer, but that requires a lot of power and needs to quickly sort the 2 different sizes of balls. I also came up with an idea for a batched scorer: The group of balls are loaded onto a platform with a spring under it, which is released when we control 5 balls. It then rotates the platform so it’s immediately ready to keep going, and a motor on the other side resets the platform that was just used.
