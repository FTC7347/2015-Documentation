Brainstorming

We have 2 different designs for both types of scorer we came up with, batched and continuous. Alex made a document containing sketches for all the designs, and Ben made a list of pros and cons. I think that the best way to score the balls is with a continuous scorer, but that requires a lot of power and needs to quickly sort the 2 different sizes of balls.
