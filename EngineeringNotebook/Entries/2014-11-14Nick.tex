\section*{building}
This week we built an intake device and a spinner. However, upon testing we decided that this setup was not optimal due to problems between the two spinners. We decided to try removing them and making a single, larger spinner that we can use both as an intake, and a launcher.
\section*{Wiring}
This week David and I worked on the wiring. We added power poles onto the wiring and then reattached it to the robot. Here is what the wiring looked like when it was not attached to the robot:
