Intake Testing

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}

 I helped test the intake.&
 Although the intake seems to work well, it will not be able to pick up balls pushed up against a wall and it takes up a lot of space in the robot. We may need to redesign it later.

I suspect that we will need to redesign the intake. I think that we will need to move it forward and down to increase the space available in the robot.
