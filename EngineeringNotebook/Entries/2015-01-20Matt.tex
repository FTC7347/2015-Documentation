Building the new deflector

We've spent the last 3 class days working on drawing up and cutting out the deflector on the cardboard. Alex gave us the 2D drawing to he wanted us to use. The first 2 days were spent getting the whole thing drawn onto the cardboard, and only yesterday did we start cutting. Neither of us have cut cardboard with the utility knife before, so Mrs. Lannen had to show us how. Once we got the idea, it started going pretty quickly.
