Post-tournament wrap up, deciding on and prioritizing new tasks

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 We brainstormed about 10 tasks, and everybody got one high priority task to work on.

 My task for the week is to find a single 18" axle to go across the front of the robot, since the axles we have at the front now are bending too much.

\end{tabular}

We competed last Saturday, January 10, and learned a lot about what we need to do. We had never actually driven our robot on the field before the competition, so we were expecting to have issues with the consistency of the robot. They were much worse than expected however. The slide we use to extend our scorer broke twice, so one of our high-priority tasks was replacing it. The gears that spin our hitter were grinding a lot, although I never did find out why. Despite all the troubles we had, we still managed to get invited into the 3rd seed alliance, and beat the 2nd seed to finish as the finalists.
