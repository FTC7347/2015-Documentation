 David and I are getting back to work on the intake prototype, now that our special tasks from last week are done. &
 We’ve finalized what we want to build, and have just started building it. \\

David and I decided that we want to build an intake that uses rotating bristles to pick up balls. The bristles need to be long enough to reach a small ball in the corner, sturdy enough to pull it in, and strong enough to force a large ball out of the corner. So far, we’ve only built the shaft that the bristles will attach to.
