Fabricating scorer tube

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 My brother and I spent about 3 hours Sunday night with our dad cutting the polycarb we're going to use to make the scorer tube. Last night, my brother and dad spent another 6 hours making it, but I had a basketball game so I couldn't help.

 We got all the polycarb cut out, and are putting it together in class.

\end{tabular}

We had hoped that we would be able to cut the polycarb with a 90 degree drill bit so it would naturally fold into a 90 degree angle for the sides of the tube, but we couldn't make that work. We ended up having to cut out and glue all the rectangles together, which took much more time.
