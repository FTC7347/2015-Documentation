Brainstorming

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 This week, I calculated the space we’d need for a scissor lift / conveyor belt mechanism. &
 The mechanism will fit and reach high enough, but it’ll take up a lot of space. \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}

I measured our team’s conveyor belt to be 2.5 inches thick.
Our robot can be up to 18 inches tall, so we can fit up to 7 layers of the conveyor belt on our robot.
We’ll need about 2.5 inches on each side of the conveyor belt for tubing to move balls between belt layers, so the belt can be up to 13 inches long.
13 inches at a 45 degree angle is approximately 9.2 inches up and to the side, meaning our scissor lift could reach up to 64 inches (163 cm).
This is well above the top of the center goal (120 cm), but I think the system will likely collapse under its own weight at that height.
