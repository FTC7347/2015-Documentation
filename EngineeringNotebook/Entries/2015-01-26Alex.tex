Testing and Finalization

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
 \hline
 New Deflector&
 The new deflector is coming along well and is almost ready to be tested. The size and shape appear to be correct, but we won't know for sure until we see it work.\\
 \hline
 New Intake&
 The new intake is working nicely. It fully met the requirements of our strategy.\\
 \hline
 Guide Tube&
 The guide tube prototype is non-functional. It is not currently useful for basing a final polycarb build off of. It needs to be fixed and technical drawings need to be made in order to effectively fabricate the polycarb. \\
\end{tabular}

Our testing indicates that we should have greatly improved robot capabilities for our next tournament. (If we can manage to get the robot functional again in time.)
