Prototyping the Intake Mechanism and Joystick Control

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}

 This week I, with several teammates, worked on prototyping the intake mechanism.

 Our current intake mechanism is a folded carboard panel. It will most likely be replaced by a more suitable material. This material must be able to deflect enough, however, to collect balls when the robot is up against a wall.

This is a diagram of our current prototype for the intake mechanism. A Tetrix channel is attached to a DC motor so it rotates as shown. The carboard, which will probably be replaced by a more suitable material, makes contact with both sizes of balls, pushing them into our yet-to-be-constructed launching mechanism.
