We remounted the front piece, begun work on the back frame holding the linear slide,  remade the intake with plastic tubing, redesigned the launcher to make more room at the front (deciding upon a chain system), and planned the part used to divert the balls, editing the angles from shifting everything back four inches.\\

Our to-do list has most of everything started but incomplete. We have all the plans to fix errors from the first competition (especially programming an autonomous). It's a shame we only got second place, but once we finish the new linear slide to replace the slow one and the launcher with less of a chance for grinding, we can test the robot out more to find bugs. We will be ready for the next tournament.
