Mentoring my Brother's FLL Team

\medskip

My younger brother is on an FLL team, coached by my dad, of which I used to be a member. This team was started back in 2009, when I was in 5th grade. My dad and another dad coached it. As of last year, I was the only official orignial team member still on the team. (My brother helped us out the first year, hence "official.") I helped the team to transfer the subroutines from last year for NXT-G 1.1 to NXT-G 2.0, as I worked on many of these programs. *not finished yet*

Here is a picture of me with the team:
